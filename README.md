Hobby project in learning to write compilers

## Name choice
Green Lantern is a comic book hero created by DC comics (http://www.dccomics.com/characters/green-lantern). The Green Lanterns wield power rings that can create anything the wearer can imagine, similarly how software developers is only limited by their imagination (and the boundaries of classical logic...). 

## Acknowledgement
This project of mine uses the designs, lessons, skills and tips by Ronald Mak's 'Writing Compilers and Interpreters A Software Engineering Approach' (ISBN: 978-0-470-17707-5).

## Using the compiler
To run the Pascal compiler issue the command
```
java -classpath bin Pascal [execute|compile] hello.pas
```
